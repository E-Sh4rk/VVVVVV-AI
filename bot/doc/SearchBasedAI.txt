Horizon H = 60 (2s)
Max number of simulations M = 1000
Step S = H/log3(M)

If many paths possible, heuristics on the final position to decide
(how close the character is from a projectile?)

If no path possible, try again with S-- (or S//2) and H=log3(M)*S

Play the first move of the selected path for STEP frames.

Note:
H must not be too big, because the prediction become wrong after some time
due to the new projectiles that appear randomly in the game.
In particular, the initial step S should be <= 10 frames.

===== PHYSICS =====

CX=6
CY=2
(coordinates in the game are IG_X = X-CX and IG_Y = Y-CY)

See player_speed.cpp for info about the computation of velocity.

-4 or less  ==> += 320		(IG_X <= -10)
317 or more ==> -= 320		(IG_X > 310)

Vertical movements:

MAX: -10 / 10

Arrived at 163: 0 -2 -5 -8 -10

Arrived at 48:  0  2  5  8  10

Collisions:

Specificity when the player is on the sides. See collisions.cpp for more info.
