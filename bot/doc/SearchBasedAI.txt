===== SEARCH =====

Max number of leaves M = 1000

Step S
Horizon H = floor(log3(M))*S

If many paths possible, heuristics on the final position to decide
(how close the character is from a projectile?)

If no path possible, try again with another lower value of S

When a solution is found, we should play at least the S first moves

===== PHYSICS =====

CX=6
CY=2
(coordinates in the game are IG_X = X-CX and IG_Y = Y-CY)

See player_speed.cpp for info about the computation of velocity.

-4 or less  ==> += 320		(IG_X <= -10)
317 or more ==> -= 320		(IG_X > 310)

Vertical movements:

MAX: -10 / 10

Arrived at 163: 0 -2 -5 -8 -10

Arrived at 48:  0  2  5  8  10

Collisions:

Specificity when the player is on the sides. See collisions.cpp for more info.

===== GRAVITRON (intermission) =====

How to detect intermission Gravitron? Lines have different widths.

Vertical movements:

MAX: -10 / 10

Arrived at >=161 (maybe 160?):  1  -1  -4  -7  -10

Arrived at <=53:  -2  1  3  6  9  10
